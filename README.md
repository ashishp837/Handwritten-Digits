# Handwritten-Digits
I found that, for hand written digits dense neural networks work better, and provide good accuracy also.
I uploaded two files,
  1. kfold.py - In this file you can see the validation of the model done by using k folds (where 'k' is user definable).
  2. final_mnist.py - In this file training and validation datas are fitted to the model in the traditional way.
